 * Author: Matt Johnson
 * Subject: arrays and vectors
 * Purpose: Illustrates section challenge
 * Date: 05/29/2023
 *
 * Instructions:
 *
 * 	Declare 2 empty vectors of integers named vector1 and vector2, respectively
 *
 * 	Add 10 and 20 to vector1 dynamically using push_back
 * 	Display the elements in vector1 using the at() method as well as its size
 * 	using the size() method
 *
 * 	Add 100 and 200 to vector2 dynamically using push_back
 * 	Display the elements in vector2 using the at() method as well as its size
 * 	using the size() method
 *
 * 	Declare an empty 2D vector called vector_2d
 * 	Remember, that a 2D vector is a vector of vector <int>
 *
 * 	Add vector1 to vector_2d dynamically using push_back
 * 	Add vector2 to vector_2d dynamically using push_back
 *
 * 	Display the elements in vector_2d using the at() method
 *
 * 	Change vector1.at(0) to 1000
 *
 * 	Display the elements in vector_2d again using the at() method
 *
 * 	Display the elements in vector1
 *
 * 	What did you expect? Did you get what you expected? What do you think
 * 	happened?
