Section 07: What is an Array
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

What is an array? 

	- Compound data type or data structure

		+ Collection of elements

	- All elements are of the same type

	- Each element can be accessed directly


Why do we need arrays?

	int test_score_1 {0};
	int test_score_2 {0};
	int test_score_3 {0};
	int test_score_4 {0};
	int test_score_5 {0};
	...
	int test_score_100 {0};

Note: this is a typical use case


Characteristics

	- Fixed size

	- Elements are all the same type

	- Stored contiguously in memory

	- Individual elements can be accessed by
	  their position or index

	
	- First element is an index 0
	
	- Last element is at index size - 1

	
	- No checking to see if you are out of 
	  bounds


	- Always initialize arrays

	- Very efficient

	- Iteration (looping) is often used to 
	  process
